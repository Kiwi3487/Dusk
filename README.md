This project contains 
4 shaders
1 "Effect" (script)
9 Scripts


**PlayerMovement script**
- Give the player the ability to move

**Camera Dark Mod**

**Text Manager**
- a UI script that is hard coded to give player directions and basic inputs

**Emission shader**
- Uses emission and a intesity and post processing to give a object a aura

**Lut shader**
- Same as the one shown in class used to make the scene lighter

**Glowpulse shader**
- uses Color, thickenss, emission and post processing to give a object a glowing effect

**Course Project**

2 effects
unity particles system (used on glowing orb)
lens flare (used on glowing orb)
2 scripts
2 textures/materials


**Texture Controller**
- using the render component to change texture from new texture and to new texture by storing all objects in a array and chnaging them manually.
  
**Lens Flare Controller**
- very similar to render shader script and player cam script where it will disable and enable a directional light on the glowing orbs to turn on and off lens flare, and the directional light will face the player so it will alway appear when the player is close enought and is facing towards it.

**Materials**
- wanted a errie abandoned design so I found a brick and terracotta tile texture online with normal mapping and height mapping
